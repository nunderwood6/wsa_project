				<p>Senator Steve Daines (R-MT) and Congressman Greg Gianforte (R-MT) claim that 29 Wilderness Study Areas in Montana are unsuitable for wilderness protection. On the basis of decades-old reviews by federal agencies, and unfazed by the  <a href="http://missoulian.com/news/local/daines-gianforte-discount-poll-showing-broad-support-for-keeping-wilderness/article_608c81e3-0b36-58c7-80e7-1abd8c309d46.html">disagreement of their constituents</a>, they have proposed opening the targeted lands to "multiple use". Multiple use often includes logging, mining, energy development, and motorized travel. If passed, their bills would comprise the single largest reduction in protected lands in Montana's history.

				<p> What do we stand to lose if these areas are developed? <a href="http://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/7/2/69/html"> A recent study by Bozeman-based ecologist Travis Belote</a> reveals that the targeted wilderness study areas are wilder, darker, and quieter in many cases than our most iconic wild places: the National Parks. Belote's analysis uses mapped data to compare each of the threatened areas to national parks on several measures of conservation value.</p>

				<p>So far, the conversation on wilderness study areas has been a disappointing reflection of the toxic climate currently reigning in the American political landscape, rife with <a href="https://westernwire.net/daines-we-should-unlock-montanas-public-lands-from-being-held-hostage/">outright lies</a>(Daines claimed in an op-ed, since edited, that hunting is not permitted in WSA’s) and an astounding <a href="http://montanauntamed.com/get-outside/article_b1227545-5966-5f60-98b2-5fedb8760d1b.html">lack of public input</a>(Gianforte held his first public meeting August 15, five months after his bill was released, Daines has held none). Belote’s research offers a great opportunity to pivot the discussion.

<p>
			Rather than a blanket release of protections for an area the size of Rhode Island, based on reviews performed over thirty years ago, we should weigh each wilderness study area individually and objectively on its merits. Explore how each of the threatened areas stacks up against our national parks with the interactive tool below.
